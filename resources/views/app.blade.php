						data-content="<p>DI utilizes two data collection methodologies to conduct it quantitative research: face-to-face and telephone surveys. DI subcontracts with local vendors to conduct face-to-face surveys, using a nationally representative, multi-stage random sampling technique. For face-to-face surveys, DI generally conducts interviews with between 1,500 and 2,500 adults. The margin of error for face-to-face surveys is generally between +/- 2.0% and 2.5% with a 95% confidence level. DI requires strict quality control protocols from its vendors, demanding at least 30% of all interviews are verified. DI pre-tests its surveys among a wide variety of demographics to assess clarity, comprehension and translation quality.</p>
	<p>DI conducts telephone surveys using its proprietary <b>Computer Assisted Telephone Survey System</b> (CATSS). Samples are drawn by randomly generating mobile phone numbers from all six mobile phone operating companies proportional to market share. For telephone surveys, DI generally conducts interviews with between 800 and 1,500 adults. The margin of error for telephone surveys is generally between +/- 2.5% and 3.5% with a 95% confidence level. Due to disproportionate levels of mobile access between men and women and in urban and rural areas, survey data is weighted to account for under-representation of women and citizens in rural areas. DI conducts internal quality control, verifying 30% of all telephone interviews. It also pretests all questionnaires and provides regular training for its interviewing staff.</p>">
